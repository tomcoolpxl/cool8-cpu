# 14. The demo disc

A COOL8 ships with sixteen volumes. This document owns what is on them,
what a demo is allowed to assume, and how to add one.

```bash
python tools/mkdemos.py --png
```

## 1. The drives

Sixteen volumes, numbered **0 to 15**, 448 KB each, in one 8 MB flash
image ([`tools/cool8disk.py`](../tools/cool8disk.py)). `DRIVE n` selects
one and everything after it — `DIR`, `SAVE`, `LOAD`, `ERA` — works on
that volume until the next `DRIVE`.

| drive | label | holds |
|---|---|---|
| 0–12 | `COOL8` | the user's, formatted and empty |
| **13** | **`DEMOS`** | **the demo disc — what this document is about** |
| 14, 15 | `COOL8` | the system discs |

13 rather than 0 so that a machine out of the box still has drive 0 for
the person using it, and so that a demo disc is somewhere a user will not
overwrite by accident on the first afternoon.

## 2. The sources are the truth, the disc is derived

`demos/*.bas` is what gets reviewed. `tools/mkdemos.py` formats the
volumes, **types each source at the machine**, and lets `SAVE` write it.

**It types rather than tokenises, and that is the whole design.** A
program on disc is tokenised, and the only thing that knows the token
table is `sw/token.asm`. A host-side tokeniser would be a second
implementation of it and would drift the first time a keyword was added —
which is the trap [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) names first and this project
has paid for a dozen times. Typing costs a few seconds a demo and cannot
be wrong.

So a demo is edited as text, rebuilt, and never patched as a binary.

## 3. What a demo may assume

**Nothing that needs the toolchain.** Demos are built and run on the VM
(`python tools/mkdemos.py --png` renders a frame), because a question
about software is a question for the fast machine — the RTL is for
questions about the hardware.

**BASIC only.** A demo that needs machine code should ship it as a PRG
and reach it with `SYS "NAME.BIN"` ([D87]), so the BASIC stays readable.

**The palette is in the bitstream** ([D77], [D79]) — sixteen banks of
sixteen, published palettes, live from reset. A demo does not seed a
palette and must not assume it may scribble on one without saying so.

## 4. The demos

### `10PRINT` — after the C64 one-liner

```
10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10
```

is the most famous BASIC program written, and has a
[book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262526746/10-print-chr205-5rnd1-goto-10/)
about it. It works because PETSCII 205 and 206 are the two diagonals,
and `RND` picks between them.

![10 PRINT](img/demo-10print.png)

**Forty columns, because the cell has to be square.** Mode 0's 80×30
cells are 8 wide by 16 high, so a diagonal drawn in one is not at 45°
and the maze comes out sheared. Forty columns makes the cell 16×16.

**It is tile mode, and that is not a preference.** The text version was
written first, in mode 1, drawing CP437's `/` and `\` at 47 and 92 with
`47 + 45*RND(2)` standing in for `205.5 + RND(1)`. It was wrong on the
screen: **those glyphs have side bearing.** They stop short of the cell
edge, so every join in the maze is broken and the picture is a field of
dashes. The text font is 4 KB of EBR read by the hardware — ROM, not
redefinable — so there is no fixing it in mode 1. Mode 2 is the same
40×30 geometry with the pattern in RAM, which is the whole difference.

**The tile is C64 screen code 77, pixel for pixel.** Transcribed from
the character ROM rather than drawn by hand, and drawing it by hand got
it wrong twice: the real glyph is two and three pixels wide, not one,
and it reaches both corners. Code 78 is its exact horizontal mirror —
checked, not assumed — so **attribute bit 6 draws the other diagonal and
one 32-byte tile serves both**, which is why the `DATA` is four lines
and not eight.

**The scroll is the hardware's, and nothing moves in memory.** The tile
map is a ring 32 rows tall with 30 shown (§5.5), so `VID_SCY` steps the
eight pixels inside a tile and one stride onto `VID_BASE` steps the row
— masked back into the ring with `AND W-1`, because software wraps the
base and the hardware only wraps its own row pointer within it. The
demo draws the row it is *about to need* and then scrolls onto it, so
the first 31 draws fill the screen and the row below before anything
moves, and no row is ever shown before it is drawn.

`MODE 2` leaves `VID_BASE` at 0 and `VID_STRIDE` at 128 — asked, not
assumed, and the demo reads the stride rather than writing 128 down.

**It is paced by a delay loop and not by the raster.** `VID_RASTER` is
bits 7:0 of a line count that runs past 255, so the same value comes
round twice a frame and BASIC cannot tell which — there is no clean
frame edge to wait on from up here.

**The palette is the C64's, copied.** Bank 0 is overwritten entry for
entry from a `DATA` table of RGB444 pairs, so 6 is `#0000AA` and 14 is
`#0088FF` — the same numbers a C64 program means when it says 6 and 14
([`tools/palette.py`](../tools/palette.py) bank 10 is the same set, kept
in the C64's own index order for the same reason). The tile is drawn in
those two indices directly: paper 6, ink 14.

## 5. Adding one

1. Write `demos/name.bas`. Keep it BASIC, keep it under 80 characters a
   line (the editor's logical line), and say in a `REM` what it is and
   where it came from.
2. `python tools/mkdemos.py --png` — it is typed in, saved, and the
   first demo is run and shot.
3. Look at the picture. `docs/img/demo-<name>.png`.
4. Add a section here saying what it demonstrates about *this* machine,
   not just what it draws.
